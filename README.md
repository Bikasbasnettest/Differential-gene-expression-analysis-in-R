# Differential-gene-expression-analysis-in-R
Differential gene expression analysis (DGEA) is a fundamental technique in bioinformatics to identify genes that exhibit significantly different expression levels between two or more experimental conditions. R, with its rich ecosystem of bioconductor packages, provides powerful tools to conduct DGEA.
